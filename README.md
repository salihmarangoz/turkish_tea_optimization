# turkish_tea_optimization

My journey to find the best way for brewing tea. Still implementing. I just need to continue brewing tea instead of making coffee to develop this further.

```bash
$ pip3 install optuna notebook
```

**To-Do Before Starting**

- [ ] Use an optimization method for high stochasticity. Default optimizer may not be good at it. 
- [ ] Print the importance values for all parameters.
